# Studies
Well, I'm Pedro Gadoti Maciel and now I'm in my first year of graduation in science and technology.

I will use this repository to save my journey through subjets involvings programming.

## My Journey
 Until here, I already the subjects: Programming Logic and Algorithms and Data Structures I.
### Programming Logic
That subject was taught using C language and these are the topics I had that semester:
- introduction to computing;
- notions of logic;
- concepts and representaion of algorithms;
- constans and variables;
- control structures;
- vectors;
- matrices;
- registration and union;
- procedings, funccions with passing parameters by values and references;
- recursion;
- introcuction to programming language.

### Algorithms and Data Structures I
That subject was taught using C language and these are the topics I had that semester:
- pointers;
- dynamic memory allocation (vectors and matrices);
- creation and manipulation of text and bynary files;
- basics concepts: asymptotic notation, abstract data types;
- representation and manipulation of data structures: statics and dynamic lists
- sequencial lists, linked and doubly linked lists, circular lists, piles, queues, queues and ppiles aplication;
- tree representation: binary search trees;
- graph representation: adjacency matrics, incidence and adjacency lists.
