# Studies
Well, I am Pedro Gadoti Maciel, and I am currently in my first year of a Bacheler of Science and Technology degree.
I will use this repository to document my journey through subjets involving programming.

## My Journey
 So far, I have completed the following subjects: Programming Logic and Algorithms & Data Structures I.
### Programming Logic
This subject was taught using C language, and the semester covered the following topics:
- Introduction to computing;
- Notions of logic;
- Algorithm concepts and representation;
- Constants and variables;
- Control structures;
- Vectors (Arrays);
- Matrices;
- Structs and Unions;
- Procedures and functions (passing parameters by value and reference);
- Recursion;
- Introduction to programming languages.

### Algorithms and Data Structures I
This subject was also taught using C, covering the following topics:
- Pointers;
- Dynamic memory allocation (vectors and matrices);
- Creation and manipulation of text and binary files;
- Basic concepts: asymptotic notation, abstract data types (ADTs);
- Representation and manipulation of data structures: static and dynamic lists;
- Sequential lists, linked and doubly linked lists, circular lists;
- Stacks, queues, and their applications;
- Tree representation: binary search trees;
- Graph representation: adjacency matrices, incidence, and adjacency lists.
